# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
We wanted to obtain the number of reviews submitted of Amazon products by vine and non vine users to determine the review quatity diffenrence between theese two groups. 

## Results
There were only 49 posted reviews of vine users and 151400 reviews of non vine users. Also the percentage of 5 star rerviews by vine users was only 18%, that's roughly one third of the group that "really loved" the product. For the non vine users, the 5 star reviews were 52%, that is more than half of the users who "loved" the product.

## Summary 
There is no positivity bias for the vine users, it seems actually that these users are even more critical of the product than those who are non vine, since only one third of them gave 5 star reviews as opposed to half of non vine users
